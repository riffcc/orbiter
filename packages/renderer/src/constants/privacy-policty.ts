    'Riff.CC itself does not collect any logs or private data or personal information at this stage beyond basic logs that web servers naturally collect. Those logs are used solely for the purposes of investigating issues and keeping Riff.CC secure and safe and do not aim to or wittingly collect any PII or sensitive information.',
    "If you sign up on the Riff.CC blog, we'll email you when cool things happen or we post new content. We will never sell your email or personal information to anyone, nor sneakily hand it to them in a way that ultimately leads to you essentially having your information sold. And you can unsubscribe any time and we'll go away, unless someone human accidentally emails you by hand outside of any form of automated mailing system.",
    "If you contribute to our project on OpenCollective, the details you share with us privately will be handled with care and discretion. Minimal details are provided to us when you donate - essentially name and amount, unless you consciously add more details. Please keep in mind that OpenCollective maintains a public record of all Riff.CC funding and development, and if you donate to us you'll be credited publicly unless you choose not to be. Look at the OpenCollective privacy policy for more details on how they handle your information if you choose to donate via OpenCollective - we do not do anything with that other than use it to fund projects. Your information is not shared with any third party in this case other than OpenCollective.",
